I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics, Cornell University.

My research interests are macroeconomics, banks, and firm dynamics. In my job market paper, I study the link between US bank concentration and the decline in startup rate.

I expect to graduate in Spring 2021 and I am available for interviews virtually.
